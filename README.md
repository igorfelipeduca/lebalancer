# Load Balancer with Round Robin Server Pool

## Work in Progress

This project implements a load balancer using a round-robin server pool strategy in Go. It's designed to distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers, ensuring high availability and efficient load distribution.

### Features

- Round-robin load balancing algorithm
- Health checking of backend servers
- Automatic skipping of unavailable servers

### Key Components

- `roundRobinServerPool`: Manages the pool of backend servers
- `GetNextValidPeer()`: Selects the next available backend server
- `Rotate()`: Implements the round-robin selection logic
- `IsAlive()`: Checks the health status of a backend server

### Usage

(TODO: Add usage instructions)

### Installation

(TODO: Add installation steps)

### Configuration

(TODO: Explain how to configure the load balancer and add backend servers)

### Contributing

This project is still in development. Contributions, ideas, and feedback are welcome. Please open an issue or submit a pull request.
